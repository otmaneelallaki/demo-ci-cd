# Python Lambda Template

This template repo is used to initiate a python lambda project with all the good stuff (lint, autoformat, test, poetry env, cicd github actions etc...)

## Poetry

The env is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
To install the project use `poetry install`
To add another package use `poetry add scipy` or `poetry add mypy --editable --group dev`. `--editable` can be dropped.
